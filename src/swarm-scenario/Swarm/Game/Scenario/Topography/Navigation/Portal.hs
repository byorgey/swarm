-- * waypoint uniqueness within a subworld when the 'unique' flag is specified

-- Waypoints are defined within a subworld and are namespaced by it.
-- Optional intra-subworld uniqueness of Waypoints is enforced at 'Swarm.Game.Scenario.Topography.WorldDescription.WorldDescription'

-- Portals are declared within a subworld. The portal entrance must be a waypoint
-- within this subworld.
-- They can reference waypoints in other subworlds as exits, but these references
-- are not validated until the Scenario parse level.
--
-- * Since portal /entrances/ are specified at the subworld level, validation that
--   no entrances overlap can also be performed at that level.
-- * However, enforcement of single-multiplicity on portal /exits/ must be performed
--   at scenario-parse level, because for a portal exit that references a waypoint in
--   another subworld, we can't know at the single-'Swarm.Game.Scenario.Topography.WorldDescription.WorldDescription' level whether
--   that waypoint has plural multiplicity.

-- | A portal can be marked as \"consistent\", meaning that it represents
-- a conventional physical passage rather than a \"magical\" teleportation.
--
-- If there exists more than one \"consistent\" portal between the same
-- two subworlds, then the portal locations must be spatially consistent
-- between the two worlds. I.e. the space comprising the two subworlds
-- forms a "conservative vector field".
--
-- Verifying this is simple:
-- For all of the portals between Subworlds A and B:
--
-- * The coordinates of all \"consistent\" portal locations in Subworld A
--   are subtracted from the corresponding coordinates in Subworld B. It
--   does not matter which are exits vs. entrances.
-- * The resulting \"vector\" from every pair must be equal.

--   traverse id (Negative x) = Negative <$> id x
-- @
-- our implementation essentially becomes @traverse id@.
--
-- However, we cannot simply write our implementation as @traverse id@, because
-- the 'traverse' function has an 'Applicative' constraint, which is superfluous
-- for our purpose.
--
-- Perhaps there is an opportunity to invent a typeclass for datatypes which
-- consist exclusively of unary (or more ambitiously, non-nullary?) data constructors,
-- for which a less-constrained 'sequence' function could be automatically derived.
-- Compare to the 'Comonad' class and its 'extract' function.

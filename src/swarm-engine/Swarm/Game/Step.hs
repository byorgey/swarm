--
-- Facilities for stepping the robot CESK machines, /i.e./ the actual
-- interpreter for the Swarm language.
--
-- == Note on the IO:
--
-- The only reason we need @IO@ is so that robots can run programs
-- loaded from files, via the 'Swarm.Language.Syntax.Run' command.
-- This could be avoided by using a hypothetical @import@ command instead and parsing
-- the required files at the time of declaration.

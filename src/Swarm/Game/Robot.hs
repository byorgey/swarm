-- | A value of type 'Robot' is a record representing the state of a
--   single robot.
data Robot = Robot
  { _robotEntity      :: Entity
    -- ^ An entity record storing the robot's name, display,
    --   inventory, and so on.

  , _installedDevices :: Inventory
    -- ^ A special inventory of devices the robot has "installed" (and
    --   thus can use).

  , _robotLocation    :: V2 Int
    -- ^ The location of the robot as (x,y).

  , _robotCtx         :: TCtx
    -- ^ Top-level type context.

  , _robotEnv         :: Env
    -- ^ Top-level environment of definitions.

  , _machine          :: CEK
    -- ^ The current state of the robot's CEK machine.

  , _tickSteps        :: Int
    -- ^ The need for 'tickSteps' is a bit technical, and I hope I can
    --   eventually find a different, better way to accomplish it.
    --   Ideally, we would want each robot to execute a single
    --   /command/ at every game tick, so that /e.g./ two robots
    --   executing @move;move;move@ and @repeat 3 move@ (given a
    --   suitable definition of @repeat@) will move in lockstep.
    --   However, the second robot actually has to do more computation
    --   than the first (it has to look up the definition of @repeat@,
    --   reduce its application to the number 3, etc.), so its CEK
    --   machine will take more steps.  It won't do to simply let each
    --   robot run until executing a command---because robot programs
    --   can involve arbitrary recursion, it is very easy to write a
    --   program that evaluates forever without ever executing a
    --   command, which in this scenario would completely freeze the
    --   UI. (It also wouldn't help to ensure all programs are
    --   terminating---it would still be possible to effectively do
    --   the same thing by making a program that takes a very, very
    --   long time to terminate.)  So instead, we allocate each robot
    --   a certain maximum number of computation steps per tick
    --   (defined in 'evalStepsPerTick'), and it suspends computation
    --   when it either executes a command or reaches the maximum
    --   number of steps, whichever comes first.
    --
    --   It seems like this really isn't something the robot should be
    --   keeping track of itself, but that seemed the most technically
    --   convenient way to do it at the time.  The robot needs some
    --   way to signal when it has executed a command, which it
    --   currently does by setting tickSteps to zero.  However, that
    --   has the disadvantage that when tickSteps becomes zero, we
    --   can't tell whether that happened because the robot ran out of
    --   steps, or because it executed a command and set it to zero
    --   manually.
    --
    --   Perhaps instead, each robot should keep a counter saying how
    --   many commands it has executed.  The loop stepping the robot
    --   can tell when the counter increments.

-- | Robots are not entities, but they have almost all the
--   characteristics of one (or perhaps we could think of robots as
--   very special sorts of entities), so for convenience each robot
--   carries an 'Entity' record to store all the information it has in
--   common with any 'Entity'.
--
--   Note there are various lenses provided for convenience that
--   directly reference fields inside this record; for example, one
--   can use 'robotName' instead of writing @'robotEntity'
--   . 'entityName'@.

-- | The robot's context

-- | A separate inventory for "installed devices", which provide the

--
--   Note that every time the inventory of installed devices is

-- | Get the set of capabilities this robot possesses.  This is only a
--   getter, not a lens, because it is automatically generated from

-- | The robot's current CEK machine state.
machine :: Lens' Robot CESK

-- | Is this robot a "system robot"?  System robots are generated by

systemRobot :: Lens' Robot Bool

-- | Does this robot wish to self destruct?
selfDestruct :: Lens' Robot Bool

-- | The need for 'tickSteps' is a bit technical, and I hope I can
--   eventually find a different, better way to accomplish it.
--   Ideally, we would want each robot to execute a single
--   /command/ at every game tick, so that /e.g./ two robots
--   executing @move;move;move@ and @repeat 3 move@ (given a
--   suitable definition of @repeat@) will move in lockstep.
--   However, the second robot actually has to do more computation
--   than the first (it has to look up the definition of @repeat@,
--   reduce its application to the number 3, etc.), so its CESK
--   machine will take more steps.  It won't do to simply let each
--   robot run until executing a command---because robot programs
--   can involve arbitrary recursion, it is very easy to write a
--   program that evaluates forever without ever executing a
--   command, which in this scenario would completely freeze the
--   UI. (It also wouldn't help to ensure all programs are
--   terminating---it would still be possible to effectively do
--   the same thing by making a program that takes a very, very
--   long time to terminate.)  So instead, we allocate each robot
--   a certain maximum number of computation steps per tick
--   (defined in 'Swarm.Game.Step.evalStepsPerTick'), and it
--   suspends computation when it either executes a command or
--   reaches the maximum number of steps, whichever comes first.
--
--   It seems like this really isn't something the robot should be
--   keeping track of itself, but that seemed the most technically
--   convenient way to do it at the time.  The robot needs some
--   way to signal when it has executed a command, which it
--   currently does by setting tickSteps to zero.  However, that
--   has the disadvantage that when tickSteps becomes zero, we
--   can't tell whether that happened because the robot ran out of
--   steps, or because it executed a command and set it to zero
--   manually.
--
--   Perhaps instead, each robot should keep a counter saying how
--   many commands it has executed.  The loop stepping the robot
--   can tell when the counter increments.

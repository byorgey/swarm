--   * If we are in creative or scroll-enabled mode, the focused robot is
--   always considered 'Close'.
--   * Otherwise, there is a "minimum radius" and "maximum radius".
--       - If the robot is within the minimum radius, it is 'Close'.
--       - If the robot is between the minimum and maximum radii, it
--         is 'MidRange', with a 'Double' value ranging linearly from
--         0 to 1 proportional to the distance from the minimum to
--         maximum radius.  For example, 'MidRange 0.5' would indicate
--         a robot exactly halfway between the minimum and maximum
--         radii.
--       - If the robot is beyond the maximum radius, it is 'Far'.
--   * By default, the minimum radius is 16, and maximum is 64.
--   * If the focused robot has an @antenna@ installed, it doubles
--     both radii.
--   * If the base has an @antenna@ installed, it also doubles both radii.

  -- Rules for selecting the "base" robot:
  -- -------------------------------------
  -- What follows is a thorough description of how the base
  -- choice is made as of the most recent study of the code.
  -- This level of detail is not meant to be public-facing.
  --
  -- For an abbreviated explanation, see the "Base robot" section of the
  -- "Scenario Authoring Guide".
  -- https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/tree/main/data/scenarios#base-robot
  --
  -- Precedence rules:
  -- 1. Prefer those robots defined with a loc in the Scenario file
  --   1.a. If multiple robots define a loc, use the robot that is defined
  --        first within the Scenario file.
  --   1.b. Note that if a robot is both given a loc AND is specified in the
  --        world map, then two instances of the robot shall be created. The
  --        instance with the loc shall be preferred as the base.
  -- 2. Fall back to robots generated from templates via the map and palette.
  --   2.a. If multiple robots are specified in the map, prefer the one that
  --        is defined first within the Scenario file.
  --   2.b. If multiple robots are instantiated from the same template, then
  --        prefer the one closest to the upper-left of the screen, with higher rows given precedence over columns.

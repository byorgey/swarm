-- | Perform some elaboration / rewriting on a fully type-annotated
--   term, given its top-level type.  This currently performs such
--   operations as rewriting @if@ expressions and recursive let
--   expressions to use laziness appropriately.  In theory it could
--   also perform rewriting for overloaded constants depending on the
--   actual type they are used at, but currently that sort of thing
--   tends to make type inference fall over.

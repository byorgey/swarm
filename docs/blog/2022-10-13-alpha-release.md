The [Swarm](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/) development team is
very proud to announce an alpha release of the game.  There are still
many missing features and known bugs, but XXX

As a reminder, Swarm is a 2D programming and resource gathering game,
written in Haskell. Notable changes since the [last progress
update](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2022/06/20/swarm-status-report/) include:

- An all-new in-game tutorial consisting of a sequence of guided challenges
- Several new challenge scenarios, and documentation on making your own
- Lots more in-game help and info, including help on currently available
  commands + recipes, and a modal showing all live robots
- Many more entities, recipes, and language features to explore and collect
- Better mouse support
- Backwards incremental search and tab completion in the REPL
- Many, many small bug fixes and improvements!

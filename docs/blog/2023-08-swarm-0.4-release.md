The [Swarm](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/) development team is
very proud to announce the latest release of the game.  This should still
be considered a development/preview release---you still can't [save
your games](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/issues/50), though
we're making progress towards that---but it's made some remarkable
progress and there are lots of fun things to try.

What is it?
-----------

As a reminder, Swarm is a 2D, open-world programming and resource
gathering game with a strongly-typed, functional programming language
and a unique upgrade system. Unlocking language features is tied to
collecting resources, making it an interesting challenge to bootstrap
your way into the use of the full language.  It has also become a
flexible and powerful platform for constructing programming challenge
scenarios.

A few of the most significant new features are highlighted below; for
full details, see the [release notes](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/releases/tag/0.4.0.0).

Expanded design possibilities
-----------------------------

A large amount of work has gone into expanding the possibilities for
level design:

- Structure templates
- Waypoints, portals, and subworlds
- A slew of new robot commands, many to do with different sensing
  modalities: `stride`, `detect`, `sniff`, `chirp,` `resonate`,
  `watch`, `surveil`, `scout`, `instant`, `push`, `density`, `use`,
  `halt`, and `backup`
- A [new domain-specific language](XXX) for describing worlds XXX
- [Key input handler](XXX) feature allows you to program robots to
  respond to keyboard input, so you can *e.g.* drive them around
  manually or XXX do other interactive things.
- New proof-of-concept integrated world editor.

XXX expanded list of challenge scenarios which make use of/illustrate
the new features.  Currently 58 scenarios and counting.  Some are
silly proofs of concept, but many are quite fun and challenging!  I
especially recommend checking out XXX adventure game or 

UI improvements
---------------

In the past, entity and goal descriptions were simply plain text;
recently, we switched to actually parsing Markdown.  Partly, this is
just to make things look nice, since we can highlight code snippets,
entity names, etc.:

But it also means that we can now validate all code examples and
entity names, and even test that the tutorial is pedagogically sound:
any command used in a tutorial solution must be mentioned in a previous
tutorial, or else our CI fails!

Also a number of small UI improvements --- improved type error
messages, inventory search, collapsible REPL panel, ...

Scenario Launch & Scoring
-------------------------

the scenario launch enhancement and scoring methods lay groundwork for
competitive play

Debugging
---------

Last but not least, we now have an [integrated single-stepping and
debugging mode](XXX) (enabled by the `tweezers` device).

Future plans & getting involved
-------------------------------

We're still hard at work on the game.  Fun upcoming things include:

- [Saving and loading games][saving]
- New world features like aliens and [cities][cities]
- New language features like [recursive types][rectypes],
  [arrays][arrays], [inter-robot communication][robot-comm], and [a
  proper `import` construct][import]

[cities]: https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/issues/112
[saving]: https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/issues/50
[rectypes]: https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/issues/154

Of course, there are also [tons of small things that need fixing and
polishing][low-hanging] too!  If you're interested in getting

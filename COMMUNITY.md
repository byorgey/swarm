# The Swarm Community

We hope that Swarm can be a catalyst for community---that many people
will be able to have fun playing, discussing, and collaborating on
Swarm together.  Here are a few resources to help you get plugged into
the community and connect with others.

- Everyone is welcome in the Swarm community.  Note the [Code of
  Conduct](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md),
  which specifically governs those contributing to the project on
  GitHub, but by extension the whole community.
- The `#swarm` channel on the [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/) IRC
  network is open to all.  At the moment it's primarily used to
  discuss development, but you're welcome to use it to discuss
  anything Swarm-related (*e.g.* asking for help, showing off your cool
  programming exploits, *etc.*).
- Feel free to make use of the [Swarm
  wiki](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/wiki) on Github as a place to
  collaborate, discuss strategy, post cool robot programs, create
  documentation, or whatever.
- We are open to other community-building tools and spaces, depending
  on the desires of people in the community, and especially as the
  community grows. For example, GitHub and IRC might be fine while
  there are just a few people hacking on it, but eventually people are
  going to want a place to post their cool screenshots, get help
  debugging, and discuss strategies.  In general, anyone should feel
  free to take the initiative on such things.  For example, someone
  could start a Discord server, or a mailing list, or something else,
  and we will add it here!

#### Capabilities

Each capability enables the evaluation of execution of one or more
commands or language constructs. Rather than listing all possible
capabilities here, which would be annoying to keep up-to-date, see the
(automatically generated) [Commands cheat
sheet](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/wiki/Commands-Cheat-Sheet)
on the Swarm wiki.

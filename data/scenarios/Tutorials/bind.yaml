        Some commands are simple, like 'move: cmd ()', because
        they do not have anything meaningful to return.
      - |
        But there are commands that do, like 'grab' that has type
        'cmd string' which means that it returns the name of the
        grabbed entity. Try it:
      - |
        'move; grab'
      - |
        To use the result later you need to use the bind notation:
      - |
        'move; t <- grab; place t'
      - |
        This can be useful if you for example do not care what you
        grabbed and just want to move it to another cell.
      - Once you are done, do 'place "Win"' to finish this challenge.
      - You might need to 'grab' the entity you are standing on
        or move to an empty cell first, since each cell can only
        contain at most one entity.

      try {
        w <- as base {has "Win"};
        return (not w);
      } { return false }
solution: |
  place "Win"
entities:
  - name: Win
    display:
      attr: device
      char: 'W'

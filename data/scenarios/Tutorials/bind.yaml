  Learn about command return types and how to bind the results.
objectives:
  - goal:
      - |
        Some simple commands, like 'move: cmd ()', do not have any meaningful value to return.
      - |
        Other commands do return a nontrivial value after executing.
        For example, 'grab' has type
        'cmd string', and returns the name of the
        grabbed entity as a string. Try it:
      - |
        'move; grab'
      - |
        To use the result later you need to use the bind notation:
      - |
        'move; t <- grab; place t'
      - |
        This can be useful, for example, if you do not care what you
        grabbed and just want to move it to another cell; or if you
        are not sure of the name of the thing being grabbed.
      - Once you are done, do 'place "Win"' to finish this challenge.
        (Note, you might need to 'grab' the entity you are standing on
        or move to an empty cell first, since each cell can only
        contain at most one entity.)
    condition: |
      try {
        w <- as base {has "Win"};
        return (not w);
      } { return false }
solution: |
  place "Win"
entities:
  - name: Win
    display:
      attr: device
      char: 'W'

name: Require inventory
description: |
  Learn how to require inventory when building robots.
goal:

    - In the previous tutorial challenge, you learned how to use
      'require' to require specific devices to be installed.
      Sometimes, instead of requiring installed devices, you require
      supplies in your inventory.  In this case, you can write
      'require <int> <name>' to require a certain number of copies of
      a certain entity to be placed in your inventory.
    - For example, 'build {require 10 "flower"; move; move}' would
      build a robot with 10 flowers in its inventory.
    - Your goal in this challenge is to cover the entire 4x4 gray area
      with rocks!
    - Remember that you can define commands to simplify your task.
    - 'For example:'
    - 'def PR = move; place "rock" end'

  def repeat = \n. \c. if (n == 0) {} {c ; repeat (n-1) c} end;
  def ifC = \test. \then. \else. b <- test; if b then else end;
  try {
    teleport self (0,0); turn south;
    repeat 4 (
      move; turn east;
      repeat 4 (
        move;
        ifC (ishere "rock") {} {create "tree"};
      );
      turn back; move; move; move; move; turn left
    );
    ifC (has "tree") {return false} {return true}
  } { return false }

  // TODO: #540 simplify this solution once we can use `def`.

  build {require 4 "rock"; move; turn right; move; place "rock"; move; place "rock"; move; place "rock"; move; place "rock"};
  build {require 4 "rock"; move; move; turn right; move; place "rock"; move; place "rock"; move; place "rock"; move; place "rock"};
  build {require 4 "rock"; move; move; move; turn right; move; place "rock"; move; place "rock"; move; place "rock"; move; place "rock"};
  build {require 4 "rock"; move; move; move; move; turn right; move; place "rock"; move; place "rock"; move; place "rock"; move; place "rock"}

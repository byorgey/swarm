  Learn about the types of commands and values.
objectives:
  - goal:
      - Before we get to solving more complex challenges,
        it would be good to get used to how the commands
        in Swarm language work and how they don't.
      - Previously, you have used the 'turn' command,
        which takes one parameter, which must be a direction.
      - What happens if you do not pass it a direction?
      - 'Try these commands:'
      - |
        'turn 1'
      - |
        'turn move'
      - |
        'turn north move'
      - |
        'move move'
      - The last two commands might give the most confusing error,
        when they are obviously missing a ';' separating the commands.
      - |
        Finally try these commands, which will just show the value
        (passing values will be useful later) and its type:
      - |
        'turn'
      - |
        'north'
      - Once you are done, do 'place "Win"' to finish this challenge.
    condition: |
      try {
        w <- as base {has "Win"};
        return (not w);
      } { return false }

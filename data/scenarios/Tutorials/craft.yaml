description: |
  Learn how to make new things using recipes.
#
# The players should read the recipes and acquaint themselves with the UI.
# This also motivates the next tutorial about obtaining entities.
#
goal:
  - Robots can use the 'make' command to make things.
  - Your base has a few trees in its inventory. Select them to see the
    available recipes.
  - Your goal is to make a "branch predictor", so you will have to make
    some "branches" first.

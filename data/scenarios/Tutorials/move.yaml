description: |
  Learn how to move and chain commands.
#
# The players might not use ';' here, so it should be brought up again when building robots.
#
goal:
  - Robots can use the 'move' command to move forward one unit
    in the direction they are currently facing.
  - To complete this challenge, move your robot two spaces to the right,
    to the coordinates (2,0).
  - Note that you can chain commands with ';'.
  - You can open this popup window at any time to remind yourself of the goal
    using Ctrl-G.

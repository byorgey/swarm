  Learn how to install devices and gain new capabilities.
goal:
    - You know how to 'grab' things lying around, so you are ready to get
      an upgrade!
    - By installing devices, you learn new capabilities which allow you to
      perform more complex commands.
    - Before you start building new robots in the later tutorials, you need
      to gain the "build" capability.
    - Try typing 'build {}' - you should get an error telling you that you
      must install a device for it first.
    - Fortunately, there is a "3D printer" lying nearby, that provides the
      missing capability, go 'grab' it.
    - When you have it, install the device with 'install base "3D printer"'.
    - 'You win by building your first robot:'
    - 'build {log "Hello World!"}'

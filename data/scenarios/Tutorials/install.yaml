  Learn how to install devices and gain new capabilities.
objectives:
  - goal:
      - You know how to `grab` things lying around, so you are ready to get
        an upgrade!
        By installing devices, you learn new capabilities which allow you to
        perform more complex commands.
      - Before you start building new robots in the later tutorials, you need
        to gain the "build" capability.
        Try typing `build {}` - you should get an error telling you that you
        need to install a "3D printer".
      - |
        Fortunately, there is a 3D printer lying nearby.  Go `grab` it, then
        install it on yourself with `install base "3D printer"`.
      - |
        You win by building your first robot:
      - |
        build {}
    condition: |
      try {
        _ <- robotNumbered 1;
        return true;
      } { return false }
solution: |
  turn south; move; grab; install base "3D printer"; build {};

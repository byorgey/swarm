  Introduction to the backstory of Swarm.
objectives:
  - goal:
      - You have crash landed on a strange planet!
        Sensors indicate the atmosphere is highly toxic, so you
        will need to stay inside your robotic base with its life support system.
        Instead, you can build robots and send them out to explore.
      - To prepare you, this simulator will walk you through a series of hands-on
        exercises that introduce you to the way robots work and the programming
        language you will use to control them.
      - When you're ready for your first challenge, close this dialog with Esc or Ctrl-G.

  Introduction to the backstory of Swarm.
objectives:
  - goal:
      - In a shockingly original turn of events, you have crash landed
        on an alien planet!  It's not clear how you'll ever get home,
        but since you're here, you might as well explore a bit. Your
        sensors indicate that the atmosphere is highly toxic, so
        you'll have to stay inside your robotic base, with its
        built-in life support system. However, you are stocked with
        all the materials you need to build robots to explore
        for you!
      - To start, you only have some very basic
        devices which can give your robots abilities like moving, turning,
        grabbing things, and interpreting very simple imperative
        programs. As you use your robots to gather resources, you will
        be able to construct better devices, which in turn allow you to
        construct robots with upgraded abilities and programming
        language features, which in turn allow you to program more
        sophisticated robots which in turn will... you get the
        idea.
      - To prepare you, this simulator will walk you through a series of hands-on
        exercises that introduce you to the way robots work and the programming
        language you will use to control them.
      - When you're ready for your first challenge, close this dialog with Esc or Ctrl-G,
        and type `place "Ready!"` (without the backticks) at the prompt.

      try {
        as base {
          b <- has "Ready!";
          return (not b)
        }
      } { return false }

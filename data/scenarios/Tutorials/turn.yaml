  Learn how to turn in some direction and pass parameters to commands.
# 
# Note that parameters are not in parentheses like in e.g. Python.

objectives:
  - goal:
      - In addition to `move`, you can use the `turn` command
        to turn your robot, for example, `turn right` or `turn east`.
      - Switch to the inventory view with Alt+E and select the treads
        device to read about the details. You can come back to the
        REPL panel with Alt+R.
      - Afterwards, move your robot to the flower in the northeast corner.
      - Remember, you can chain commands with `;`, for example `move; move; move;`.

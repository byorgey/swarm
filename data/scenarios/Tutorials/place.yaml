  Learn how to interact with the world by harvesting entities and placing them.
#
# Placing the tree is motivated by speeding up tree collection as their growth
# is really slow. It can be cheesed by speeding up the game, but there is no need
# to tell the players. :)

goal:
  - Previously you learned how to plunder a plentiful forest for wood.
    Now you will learn how to plant trees to obtain as much wood as you need.
  - There is a fast-growing tree (called "spruce") ahead of you.  You could 'grab'
    it as before, but you now have a new device called a 'harvester'.
    If you 'harvest' a tree rather than 'grab' it, a new tree will grow in its
    place.
  - You can plant a tree seed by 'place "spruce"; harvest' - that way you can
    immediately place the next seed.
  - You can speed this up by placing the tree in all available cells.
    That way you can have eight times as many trees growing at once.
  - Your goal is to collect 6 trees.

    TIP: You can get a sneak peak at a feature we will explain later and type
    'def t = move; place "spruce"; harvest; end' after which you only need to type 't'
    instead of retyping the whole command or searching in your command history.

      A tall, living entity made of a tough cellular material called "wood".
      They regrow after being harvested and are an important raw ingredient used
      in making many different devices.

      This one seems to grow a little faster.

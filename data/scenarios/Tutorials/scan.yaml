  Learn how to send robots to safely scan your surroundings.
objectives:
  - goal:
      - When you land on an alien planet, all the entities in the
        world will be unfamiliar to you.
      - But you can learn what they are using the scanner device.
      - Send robots to move to the unknown entities (marked as '?'),
        'scan forward' and after that come back and 'upload base'.
      - |
        TIP: You can also 'scan left' or 'scan north', to save on a few
        'turn' commands.

  build {
    turn east; move; move; move;
    turn left; move;
    scan left; scan forward; scan east;
    turn back; move;
    turn west; move; move; move;

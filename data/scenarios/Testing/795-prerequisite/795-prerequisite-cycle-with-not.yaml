  Prerequisite objectives: non-dependency cycle due to the NOT
description: |
  This should NOT be rejected by the parser.
  The two objectives do reference each other,
  but the NOT is a distinct reference from the non-negated goal.
objectives:
  - goal:
      - Make a "furnace".
    condition: |
      as base {has "furnace"};
    id: have_furnace
    prerequisite:
      not: have_gear
  - goal:
      - Make a "wooden gear".
    condition: |
      as base {has "wooden gear"};
    id: have_gear
    prerequisite: have_furnace
solution: |
  make "wooden gear";
  make "furnace";

        Congratulations on the grand opening of your new ice cream shop.
        You have advertised: "All you can eat, for 1 `bitcoin`{=entity}!"
      - |
        A customer is approaching the `Counter`{=entity}. They look hungry!
      - "..."
      - |
        Customer: "`give` me a cone, and then I'll tell you how many scoops I want."
      - "..."
      - |
        Oh dear, you've forgotten to provision your shop with a `calculator`{=entity}.
        Let's hope this order is simple.
    condition: |
      customer <- robotnamed "customer";
      as customer {has "cone"};
  - teaser: Complete the order
    goal:
      - |
        `give` the customer exactly what they request.
      - |
        Perhaps there is something else around the shop that can assist with
        preparing the order...

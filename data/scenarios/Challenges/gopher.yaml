        A gopher (G) is defiling your immaculate garden!
      - |
        He will burrow (o) underground awhile, then pop up
        anywhere within the rectangular grassy region
        to gloat atop his "mound" of dirt for a short time.
        `drill` the "mound" while he sits to drive him
        away. Eventually you should wear down his resolve!

    - Before we get to solving more complex challenges,
      it would be good to get used to how the commands
      in Swarm language work and how they don't.
    - Previosly, you have used the 'turn' command,
      which takes one parameter, which must be a direction.
    - What happens if you do not pass it a direction?
    - 'Try these commands:'
    - |
      'turn 1'
    - |
      'turn move'
    - |
      'turn north move'
    - |
      'move move'
    - The last two commands might give the most confusing error,
      when they are obviosly missing a ';' separating the commands.
    - |
      Finally try these commands, which will just show the value
      (passing values will be useful later) and its type:
    - |
      'turn'
    - |
      'north'
    - Once you are done, do 'place "Win"' to finish this challenge.
  - name: Win
    display:
      attr: device
      char: 'W'

    - Before you send your robots far away you need to learn how
      to figure out what went wrong with them if they crash.
    - Send a robot to walk four steps straight east into the mountain,
      but use the bind syntax 'r <- build {COMMANDS}'.
    - |
      Since you expect the robot will crash into the mountain,
      add a 'log' command so that we will see what command failed:
    - |
      'r <- build {log "Hi!"; move;move;move; log "3"; move; log "OK"}'
    - After that you can 'view r', to see how far it got.
    - The instructions on how to win will appear in the crashed robots log.

      char: 'W'

      - Do 'place "Win"' once you are done with this challenge.
      - You might need to 'grab' the entity you are standing on
        or move to an empty cell.
